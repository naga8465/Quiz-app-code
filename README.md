   - Example:
     - **Question:** "If the base sequence in DNA is 5' AAAT 3', what is the corresponding mRNA sequence?"
     - **Answer:** "5' AAAU 3'"
     - **Explanation:** Detailed step-by-step reasoning for transcription.

### 2. **Reading Materials**
   - HTML-based reading materials explaining key concepts.
   - Includes diagrams, definitions, and examples for better understanding.

### 3. **Practice Materials**
   - Interactive content to reinforce learning.
   - Keywords and summaries for quick revision.

### 4. **Keywords**
   - Lists of important terms and their definitions for each topic.

## 📖 Sample Content

### Example Question
**Q:** Ribose is differentiable from deoxyribose in having:
- **Options:**
  - Two extra oxygen
  - No oxygen
  - Hydroxyl group at 2nd carbon
  - One extra hydrogen
- **Correct Answer:** Hydroxyl group at 2nd carbon
- **Explanation:** Ribose has a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 2' carbon, while deoxyribose has a hydrogen atom (-H) at that position.
